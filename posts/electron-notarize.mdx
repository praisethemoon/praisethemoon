Most of cases, I would just write about things that are more less unique, or topics i am really passionate about. But given the messy state (IMO) of electron and its eco-system as well the complexity
of code signing and notarization, I thought it would be a good idea to write about it, and save some people some time (hopefully)
{/* excerpt */}
## Preface
I am working on a new project, called MoonPiano, its an awesome Piano Learning app, have a look at it: https://moonpiano.io

During the development of MoonPiano, I had to deal with code signing and notarization of the app. This tutorial is a result of my experience with it.

## First and Foremost

1. The tutorial written by `kilianvalkhof` https://kilianvalkhof.com/2019/electron/notarizing-your-electron-application/ is a good starting point. However, it is outdated. The process has changed a bit.
2. This guide uses `electron-builder` to build the app. I am not sure if it works with other builders.
3. I am only discussing MacOS Code Signing / notarization. I have given up on Windows, absurd code signing certificate prices.
4. Expects you to have a valid Apple Developer account and generate an apple app specific password.

## Let's get started.
Now this tutorial assumes that you have a valid Apple Developer account. If you don't have one, you can get one for free. However, you will need to pay $99/year to get your signing certificate.

### Step 1: Making sure you have the right certificate
Make sure you are signing with a `Developer ID Certificate`. This is different from `Development` or the certificate that issued by default.

Not sure? Have a look at https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list and see if your certificate is of the right category.
If not you have to request it.

Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64168569/electron-notarize-problem-not-signing-all-binaries.

### Step 2: Export the certificate as a `.p12` file
Now you will want to download your certificate, import it to your keychain.
I personally had to generate `.p12` file from Xcode, Xcode -> Preferences -> (Login with Apple ID if you have not) -> Select your ID -> Manage Certificates -> Right click the certificate -> Export.
Try to not forget your password, you will need it later (yeah no sh*t)

### Step 3: Setting up test environment
Now you will want to create a `electron-builder.env` at the root of your project, this is where electron-builder will load the environment variables from.
** DO NOT ADD THIS FILE TO YOUR REPO **
Now within this, we will need to define the following variables:

```
APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=[any app specific password]
APPLE_ID=[apple acc email]
APPLE_TEAM_ID=
CSC_LINK=~/path/to.p12
CSC_KEY_PASSWORD=[password used to export the certificate]
```
I have left `APPLE_TEAM_ID` empty, because I did not need it. And due to another fact, that now, electron-builder does not respect
`afterBuild` hook, so you can't use your custom notarization script (which would use `electron-notarize` package to notarize the app). Electron will perform this by default
(source: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/8103)

So remove the `afterBuild` hook from your `package.json` if you have it.

### Step 4: Setting up the Team ID
You can try and build now, but you will still receive the same issue as in the previously linked github issue.
Solution is to add the 
```ts
"mac": {
    /// .. 
    "notarize": {
        "teamId": "YOUR_TEAM_ID"
      }
    /// ..
}
```
 to your `package.json`. If you are using `electron-builder.ymk` you will want to switch to
`electron-builder.ts` instead. Because the `notarize` field in yml config, expects a boolean value.

So your `electron-builder.ts` would have a config as follows:
```ts
mac: {
    entitlements: "build/entitlements.mac.plist",
    entitlementsInherit: "build/entitlements.mac.plist",
    hardenedRuntime: true,   // !
    gatekeeperAssess: false, // !
    "notarize": {
        "teamId": "XYZ"
    },
    // ...
}
```

### Step 5: Building the app
Now you can build the app. If everything goes well, you should see the app being built and notarized.
Otherwise drop a comment below, I will try to help you out.
