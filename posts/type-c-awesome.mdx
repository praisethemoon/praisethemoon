Type-C has been announced to the public! And it rocks! In this post, we will dive into some of its features and how they work under the hood.
{/* excerpt */}

## Type-C Release
I have posted about Type-C on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1gu1krv/typec_programming_language/) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/praisethemoon/type-c-programming-language-3cj3) and now
let's look at some of its features!

## A Look at Type-C in Action
Type-C offers most features you would expect from a AAA programming language. It has a strong type system, generics, classes, closures, you know the drill.

In this post we will look at a specific example, `std.array.Array` class.

This class provides a basic `Array` class to push/pop elements. The class definition is rather large, so we will focus only on small parts of it.

```tc
type Array<T> = class AbstractArray<T> {
    let data: T[]
    let len: u64
    let capacity: u64

    fn init(mut data: T[]) {
        this.data = data
        this.len = data.length
        this.capacity = this.len
    }

    /* other methods */

    fn map<Z>(f: fn (x: T) -> Z) -> Array<Z> {
        let result1 = new Array<Z>([])
        for let i: u64 = 0; i < this.len; i = i + 1 {
            result1.push(f(this.data[i]))
        }

        return result1
    }

    fn toIterator() {
        let iterator = cfn() -> (T, bool) {
            let counter: u64 = 0

            for let i: u64 = 0; i < this.len-1; i = i + 1 {
                let value = this.data[i]
                yield (value, false)
            }

            let value = this.data[this.len-1]
            yield! (value, true)
        }

        return coroutine iterator
    }
}
```

In this post, I will go through two things, Generics and Coroutines&Closures.

## Generics
Similar to TypeScript, Type-C's compiler is able to identify generics from usage. This applies to all class method except the constructor methods.

Let's look at `map` method:

```tc
    fn map<Z>(f: fn (x: T) -> Z) -> Array<Z> {
        let result1 = new Array<Z>([])
        for let i: u64 = 0; i < this.len; i = i + 1 {
            result1.push(f(this.data[i]))
        }

        return result1
    }
```

It requires an argument `f` which is a function that takes a single argument of type `T` and returns a value of type `Z`.

Now let's see it in action:

```tc
from std.io import println
from std.array import Array

fn main() {
    let x: Array<u32> = new Array<u32>([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])


    let y = x.map(fn(x: u32) = "#"+x)
    println(y[0])

    return 0
}
```

If we compile this:
```bash
(base) praisethemoon@praisethemoons-MacBook-Pro type-c % node outs/index.js -c ./tests/template -o ./output --run

| 1    | R255 | 0  | 0  | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 0x0 | 0   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Ignore the table and the env-text which showcases the runtime info. `#1` is our std output.

The compiler is able to recursively infer the concrete type of `Z`, by recursively looking at the parameter given.

How does this happen? Well the expression `fn(x: u32) = "#"+x` is inferred as (pseudocode):
```json
{
    "kind": "FunctionType",
    "args": [
        {
            "kind": "BasicType",
            "name": "u32"
        }
    ],
    "returnType": {
        "kind": "ReferenceType",
        "name": "String"
    }
}
```

Now since `map` method belongs to a generic class, once we create a concrete type of it, the method is cloned, where each generic type is replaced with the concrete type.
Hence resulting in map which requires the following argument type:

```json
{
    "kind": "FunctionType",
    "args": [
        {
            "kind": "BasicType",
            "name": "u32"
        }
    ],
    "returnType": {
        "kind": "GenericType",
        "name": "Z"
    }
}
```

Now if we compare them side by side:

<img src="/images/tc-awesome/concrete-generic-diff.png" alt="Vector" />

There we have it! We clone the function once again, replacing the generic type `Z` with the concrete type `String`.

This process of recursively extracting the concrete type from the function is done through the method `getGenericParametersRecursive` implemented in every
data type in the compiler, let's have a look at an example:


#### StructType
```ts
export class StructType extends DataType {
    fields: StructField[];

    /* .. other fields and methods */

    getGenericParametersRecursive(ctx: Context, originalType: DataType, declaredGenerics: {[key: string]: GenericType}, typeMap: {[key: string]: DataType}) {
        if(this.preGenericExtractionRecursion()){
            return;
        }

        // make sure originalType is a StructType
        if(!originalType.is(ctx, StructType)){
            ctx.parser.customError(`Expected struct type when mapping generics to types, got ${originalType.shortname()} instead.`, this.location);
        }

        let structType = originalType.to(ctx, StructType) as StructType;
        for(let i = 0; i < this.fields.length; i++){
            // make sure field names matches
            if(this.fields[i].name != structType.fields[i].name){
                ctx.parser.customError(`Expected field ${this.fields[i].name}, got ${structType.fields[i].name} instead.`, this.location);
            }

            this.fields[i].type.getGenericParametersRecursive(ctx, structType.fields[i].type, declaredGenerics, typeMap);
        }

        this.postGenericExtractionRecursion()
    }
}
```

This method is called on a data type that might contain generic, so in our case, `map`.

First, notice the method `preGenericExtractionRecursion` and `postGenericExtractionRecursion`. These are used to prevent infinite recursion when a generic type is used in a recursive data structure.
The first thing this function does (after avoiding our compiler to die), is to make sure we are comparing a `StructType` with another `StructType`. Then it iterates through the fields of the struct, making sure the field names match, and then recursively calls `getGenericParametersRecursive` on the field type.

Now let's look at its parameters:
- `ctx`: The context of the current compilation
- `originalType`: The original type of the struct (it is the concrete type, because `this` is the generic type)
- `declaredGenerics`: The generics we expect to find, these are extracted from the definition, for example `map<Z>`, `Z` is the declared generic.
- `typeMap`: A map of the generic types to the concrete types. At the end, every generic type in `declaredGenerics` needs to be replaced with the concrete type.

If we are, we call the function recursively on each field. This is the same behavior for every data type that has subfields.

This process ends when we enter `GenericType.getGenericParametersRecursive` which is the base case of the recursion. This function is responsible for replacing the generic type with the concrete type.


Since `GenericType` is our terminal, let's look at its implementation:

#### GenericType

```ts
export class GenericType extends DataType {
    name: string;
    constraint: GenericTypeConstraint;
    constructor(location: SymbolLocation, name: string, constraint: GenericTypeConstraint) {
        super(location, "generic");
        this.name = name;
        this.constraint = constraint;
    }

    /* .. other fields and methods */
    getGenericParametersRecursive(ctx: Context, originalType: DataType, declaredGenerics: {[key: string]: GenericType}, typeMap: {[key: string]: DataType}) {
        // make sure this is a declared generic
        if(!(this.name in declaredGenerics)){
            ctx.parser.customError(`Generic type ${this.name} is not declared`, this.location);
        }

        // make sure the original type matches the constraint
        if(!this.constraint.checkType(ctx, originalType)){
            ctx.parser.customError(`Generic type ${this.name} does not match constraint`, originalType.location);
        }

        if(this.name in typeMap){
            // we do not allow generics to satisfy different constraints in one instance!
            // hence we need to check if the specified type and the current type match
            let res = matchDataTypes(ctx, typeMap[this.name], originalType);
            if(!res.success){
                // Find a common type
                let commonType = findCompatibleTypes(ctx, [typeMap[this.name], originalType]);
                if(commonType === null){
                    ctx.parser.customError(`Generic type ${this.name} do not match its same instance: expected ${typeMap[this.name].shortname()}, but ${originalType.shortname()} found`, originalType.location);
                }
                else {
                    // we match the common type against the constraint of the generic type
                    if(!this.constraint.checkType(ctx, commonType)){
                        ctx.parser.customError(`Inferred generic type ${this.name}: ${commonType.shortname()} does not match constraint, found multiple different usages of generic type: ${typeMap[this.name].shortname()} and ${originalType.shortname()}`, originalType.location);
                    }

                    // we update the type map
                    typeMap[this.name] = commonType;
                }
            }
        }
        else {
            typeMap[this.name] = originalType;
        }
    }
}
```

Now the method has a different behavior that calling the same method on all its subfields! Since it is a terminal it needs to check a few conditions:
- Is the generic present in the declared generics? If not, it is an error.
- Is the generic already in the type map? If so, we need to make sure the type matches the constraint (if applicable)
- If the generic is not in the type map, we add it to the type map.
- If the generic is in the type map, we need to compare the existing type and the new one
    - If the types match exactly, we are good
    - If the types do not match, we find a common type and override the type map with the common type.
        - If the common type does not match the constraint, it is an error.
        - If the common type matches the constraint, we are good.

Now that's a lot of rules. But it is necessary to make sure the generic types are used correctly. This is the core of the type system in the compiler.

## Coroutines and Closures
```tc
    fn toIterator() {
        let iterator = cfn() -> (T, bool) {
            let counter: u64 = 0

            for let i: u64 = 0; i < this.len-1; i = i + 1 {
                let value = this.data[i]
                yield (value, false)
            }

            let value = this.data[this.len-1]
            yield! (value, true)
        }

        return coroutine iterator
    }
```

This function is our main focus! As it does two things in one line:
`return coroutine iterator` first of all, just the mention of `iterator` as reference to a function creates a closure. Then based on this closure, it creates a coroutine.

You start to see a bit of how the VM functions here, coroutine expects a closure and they work hand-in-hand pretty well, because for a closure, the upvalues will need to be backedup after it returns,
but coroutines already persist the registers.

Let's have a look at an example using this:

```tc
from std.io import println
from std.array import Array


fn main() {
    let x: Array<u32> = new Array<u32>([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

    let iter = x.toIterator()

    let e: u32 = 0
    let end: bool = false

    while !end {
        (e, end) = iter()
        println("Element: " + e)
    }

    return 0
}
```

This code will print (with non-sense removed):
```bash
Element: 1
Element: 2
Element: 3
Element: 4
Element: 5
```

Let's explore the IR of this method:


<img src="/images/tc-awesome/ir.png" alt="Vector" />

Type-C IR is a bit different from regular IR, it assumes infinite disposable registers (with `destroy_tmp`), and assumes reference assignment for everything.

So for example:
```
tmp_ptr tmp_1 arg x
tmp_ptr tmp_1 tmp tmp_2
```
It means `tmp_1` references local argument `x` and then assigned `tmp_2`, essentially updating `x` since all values have to go through registers first.

Now let's get back on track.

In Type-V, closure env are passed as arguments, right after the regular function arguments, in our case, `cfn` takes 0 arguments. So the closure env is passed as the first argument.

```
closure_alloc tmp_1068 0 1 ; allocates a closure with 1 upvalue passed as arg from offset 0

tmp_ptr tmp_1070 arg $this ; assigns $this argument, which is a hidden argument for the method to the tmp_1070 register
closure_push_env_ptr tmp_1068 tmp_1070 ; pushes the $this argument to the closure env as a pointer

tmp_ptr tmp_1073 local ctx_199_iterator_0; loads local variable iterator to tmp_1073
coroutine_alloc tmp_1072 tmp_1073; allocates a coroutine with the closure env

tmp_ptr tmp_1071 local ctx_199_iterator_0 ; loads local variable iterator to tmp_1071
tmp_ptr tmp_1071 reg tmp_1068 ; assigns the closure env to the iterator

tmp_ptr tmp_1073 local ctx_199_iterator_0; load local variable iterator to tmp_1073
coroutine_alloc tmp_1072 tmp_1073 ; allocates a coroutine with the closure tmp_1073 into tmp_1072

ret_ptr tmp_1072 0; return the coroutine
ret_void ; jump back to caller
```

Sadly the graph plot of main is not as nice as it has jumps and all.

If you want to look into it yourself, compile with `--generate-ir` flag and you will see `dot` files in the output directory you provided to the compiler.
